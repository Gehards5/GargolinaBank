# GargolinaBank This program is made to work like a very old i-bank. But I got error:
                  File "C:\Users\Edmunds\Desktop\Python projects\PyGargolinaBank\PyGargolinaBank\account.py", line 9, in Account
                    @Currensy.setter
                NameError: name 'Currensy' is not defined (WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)
   
   And I dont know how to slove it. Also I am busy to learn GUI - Tkinter. I could say - this bug is hard to catch. This is my first ever 
   project, that I made in python.
